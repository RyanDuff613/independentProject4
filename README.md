## Purpose
###### This project is intended to demonstrate my knowledge of and comfortability with creating and manipulating Javascript objects using Constructors and Prototypes. It is a website that prompts a user to order a pizza with options for size and toppings. When the user submits their order the site calculates a price and returns it to the user.
